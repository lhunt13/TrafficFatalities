The folder “code” contains all the code needed for producing the figures and conducting the analysis in the R Markdown. The file “DownloadData.R” is not used by the R Markdown file, since we provide the data already downloaded for the user. However, if the user wishes to download data from more years we leave the code for them. 

The folder “data” contains the data used for this project, as well as the data dictionary.
