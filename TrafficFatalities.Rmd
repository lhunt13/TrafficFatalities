# Introduction
Did the legalization of Marijuana in Colorado decrease the proportion of traffic fatalities involving drunk driving? Legalization may have allowed people to replace alcohol use with marijauna, leading to less drinking and driving, which in turn may have lead to fewer drunk driving fatalities.

There may be some overall background shift in the proportion of fatal crashes involving drunk driving, so we cannot simply compare proportions in Colorado before and after legalization. To account for confounding due to time we ...

We will use Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for years 2009 to 2015. 

To do:

1. Determine potential confounders (Sex, Age)
2. Figure out how to account for general secural trend throughout the US
3. Should we use crash level data or person level data? 

# Methods
## Data Acquisition
We used FARS data provided by the NHTSA, which we downloaded from ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/fars. They provide data on every car fatality in the US from 1975 to 2015.

## Key Variable Definitions
The main variable we are concerned with is DRUNK_DR. As of 2008, this variable indicates whether a driver was tested positive for alcohol OR was reported to be under the influence by the police. 

## Statistical Analysis
We will perform a difference in differences analysis using a binomial model with a linear link. As a reference population we will use ...

We will control for age and gender.


# Results

# Discussion
## Limitations
Difference-in-differences is a causal analysis that takes advantage of the assumption that secular trends in two comparable locations are similar. However, this assumption may not hold.

We only have data for 3 years after the legalization of Marijuana in Colorado, which may not be enough. 

The weight we chose for traffic fatality counts may not be appropriate.Since different proportions of the population may be driving in different states, it may not serve as the optimal measure. A more appropriate weight would be to use some measure of the number of drivers on the road (e.g., average traffic density for a state, or the number of individuals with a drivers license in the state).
