# Introduction
In 2014, in response to concerns about having some of the highest rates of drunk driving fatalities in the United states, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted Emma's law, which requires first-time DUI offenders with a blood-alcohol content (BAC) greater than 0.15 to install an ignition interlock device on their vehicles for 6 months. The device requires drivers to blow into a breathalyzer before starting their car, as well as periodically throughout their drive. If the driver's BAC surpasses the legal limit, the car cannot be started. 

In this report, we examine whether there was a change in the proportion of drivers involved in a traffic fatality who were driving under the influence following the enactment of Emma's law. We use Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). We perform an interrupted time series analysis on monthly data for years 2008 to 2015, with an interruption specified on January 1st, 2015, when the law came into effect. 

The findings will be informative for future legislators seeking to reduce the public health burden of drinking and driving. 


# Methods
## Data Acquisition
We used FARS data provided by the NHTSA, which we downloaded from ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/fars. They provide data on every car fatality in the US from 1975 to 2015.

## Key Variable Definitions
The outcome is proportion of drivers involved in a traffic fatality who were reported to have been drunk by police, or who had BAC measured above 0.05.

## Statistical Analysis


We compute the proportion on a monthly basis from years 2008 to 2015, and perform an interrupted time series analysis with an interruption at January 1st, 2015. 

# Results

# Discussion
## Limitations
We only had data on one year since the law was enacted, thereby limiting our results. Moreover, it is difficult to make any causal claims given the observational nature of the data. However, this is necessarily  

## Conclusion

## Further study
