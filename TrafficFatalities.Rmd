# Introduction
Marijuana became completely legalized in Colorado in 2012. The first sales at dispenceries began on January 1st, 2014. If citizens of Colorado began using marijuana as a substitute for alcohol, it is feasible that traffic fatalities involving a drunk driver decreased in the years following marijuana legaliztion. We examine this question using Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). We will perform an interrupted time series analysis on monthly data for years 2008 to 2015, with an interruption specified at 2012 (when it became legal to posses marijuana in Colorado) and 2014 (when commercial retail stores began selling marijuana).

ALTERNATIVE:
In 2014, in response to concerns about having some of the highest rates of drunk driving fatalities in the United states, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted Emma's law, which requires first-time DUI offenders with a blood-alcohol content (BAC) greater than 0.15 to install an ignition interlock device on their vehicles for 6 months. The device requires drivers to blow into a breathalyzer before starting their car, as well as periodically throughout their drive. If the driver's BAC surpasses the legal limit, the car cannot be started. 

In this report, we examine whether Emma's law significantly impacted the risk of drunk driving fatalities in South Carolina. We use Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). We perform an interrupted time series analysis on monthly data for years 2008 to 2015, with an interruption specified on January 1st, 2015, when the law came into effect. 

The findings will be informative for future legislators seeking to reduce the public health burden of drinking and driving. 


# Methods
## Data Acquisition
We used FARS data provided by the NHTSA, which we downloaded from ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/fars. They provide data on every car fatality in the US from 1975 to 2015.

## Key Variable Definitions


## Statistical Analysis
The outcome is proportion of drivers involved in a traffic fatality who were reported to have been drunk by police, or who had BAC measured above 0.05. We choose 0.05 somewhat arbitrarily, as this is below the legal limit in many states. However, we believe that capturing data on drivers who were required to take a breathylizer test and who scored above 0.05 will capture something informative about the impact of drinking and driving on traffic fatalities. 

We compute the proportion on a monthly basis from years 2008 to 2015, and perform an interrupted time series analysis with an interruption at January 1st, 2015. 

# Results

# Discussion
## Limitations
We only had data on one year since the law was enacted, thereby limiting our results. Moreover, it is difficult to make any causal claims given the observational nature of the data. However, this is necessarily
