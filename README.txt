READ ME:

Place the folder “data” (it has a bunch of subfolders like “fars2000”, “fars2001” etc…) in your working directory and run the R markdown file “TrafficFatalities.Rmd”.

The data folder can be found here: 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qgmmikpw2f66761/AAAQVIw2fIV4Ak8C9riHbvqAa?dl=0

If you cannot place the “data” folder in your working directory, then run the R markdown file “Supplementary.Rmd” first. This should download the data necessary to your working directory, so then you can run “TrafficFatalities.Rmd”.
